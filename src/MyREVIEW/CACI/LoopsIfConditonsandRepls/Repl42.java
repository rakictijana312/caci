Write a program using the switch statement.

Let us consider there are three students in the class with roll number  starting from (101 to 103)
if any number other than 101-103 are present display "Not found Student name: in Class"

```
First Output: "Enter the roll number of the Child"
```

```
case 101: if roll number is 101 print as "Student name: Ramesh"
```

```
case 102 :if roll number is 102 print as "Student name: Mahesh"
```

```
case 103:if roll number is 103 print as "Student name: Mukesh"
```

```
Other than this roll number  it should print "Not found Student name: in Class"
```
