Selenium class 2

What is WebElement?
Anything we see on web page is consider to be a web belement:
buttons, texboxes, checkboxes, dropdowns, radio buttons.

HTML?
HyperText Markup language

What is DOM?
DOM stands for Document Object Modul. It is broswer's internal view of webpage.
Also called DEVELOPER TOOL.

Document: can be stored any document, like pdf, word
Object: any line in HTML is called OBJECT.
Model:  its just layout of the HTML file in DOM.

WHAT IS LOCATOR?
Locator is in address or position of a web element on the web page.
It is use to locate of identify the webelemnt on the webpage.

Locators:ID
         Name
         LinkText
         partialLinkText
         className
         tagName
         XPath
         CSS Selector

HTML script meaning:
purple - tags
brown/orange - atributes
blue - atributes value
Those 3 we will only follow and they are the most important

Why do we need so many locators?
-Some locators might have duplicate values
-Developers migh not provide all the locators for the same element
-Some locators may not be applicable to all elements.
e.g. linktext/ partialLinkText are only use for links


"a" tag in HTML is called ancor tag
If 2 or more elements have same attributes and attributes value
selenium will only see the first one and will only interact with first element
