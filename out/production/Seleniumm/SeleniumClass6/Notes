Class 6

Alerts:
Alert is pop up message. Alert takes complete focus  on our main page that we are
working on
We can not proceed until is handled.

3 types of alerts:
1.web based alerts /html alerts - we can simply inspect and preform needed actions
2.Javascript alerts/browser alerts - we can handle these alerts by using swichTo() method in Selenium, we can not inspect them
3.Windows based alerts - we can not handle them with Selenium

Types of JavaScript alerts:
1. simple alert - click on(accept, getText only methods can be used)
2. confirmation alert - we can cancel or click on (all accept sendKey can be used)
3.prompt alert - enter text and click ok(

To handle JS alerts we have 4 methods:
1. accept();
2.dismiss();
3.getAText();
4.sendKeys
Interview:
How do you handle alerts in Selenium?
We handle alerts by using Alert interface

Frames:
Frame is separate independent window in our webpage
Frame allow devs to present multiple views in one page

3 ways to interact with frames:
 1. by index //try to use as less posible because can break your code
 2. by name or id
 3. by WebElement
 in alerts  -- switch to alert manually and swich back automaticly
 in frames -- swich to frames maualy and we swich back manully
